  By default the javaScript is 
       => Synchronous language and also
       => sigle threaded language
that executes the context
       => one line of code at one time

console.log('First execute);
console.log('Second execute);
       => each step wait for the last one to complete before executing
 

Q#01-:  Blocking code vs Non-Blocking code ??

Blocking code -:   
     =>  Block the flow of the code [Exmaple : dont do any work, until i reached ]
     =>  Read the file as Sync     // until its execution , other code will not work
Non-Blocking code -: 
     =>  Don't block the flow of the code [Exmaple : Continue your work, until i reached ]
     =>  Read the file as Async   //do other work , i will retrive other data from file.
[

// next example is : agar aik user register kr rha hi aur usko me msg dta hn k registration successful , 
// until uski registration abhi baaqi hi, to Async yaha pe galat ho jaye ga., so this is not best choise
// koi bhi chwz galat ya sai ni hti , 
// hr aik ka usecase hta hi.issi liye kayi bar blocking lokhna prta hia aur kayi baar non-blocking loikhna prta hi
