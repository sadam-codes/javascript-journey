1- Object datatype 
2- key in Object
3- datatype of key ?
4- Unique Properties of Keys in JavaScript Objects
             Keys Are Always Strings or Symbols
             Keys Are Unique
             Order of Keys (integer and then string)
             Keys Can Store Functions

5- Hashing in js ? 
            Define ???
            The process of converting data (such as a string or object) into a fixed-size string of characters,
            often represented as a hash code or digest. Hashing is widely used in computer science and
            programming for purposes like quick data lookups, password storage, and ensuring data integrity.

            Key Features of Hashing ???
            i-  Fixed Output Size -: Regardless of the input size, a hash function generates a fixed-size output
            ii- Irreversible-: Hashing is generally one-way; it’s difficult to derive the original input from its hash value.

            Common Uses of Hashing in JavaScript ???
             i-  Password Security
            
            Hash Functions in JavaScript ???
            JavaScript doesn’t have a built-in hash function in its standard library, but you can use libraries like crypto (Node.js) or third-party libraries for hashing.
                 
            const crypto = require('crypto');

            // Create a hash from a string
            const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256')
                   .update('Hello, World!')
                   .digest('hex');

            console.log(hash); // Example output: "315f5bdb76d0f4b6c0d45d2161de00c51b3c11baf8304b0ccebebcd2"




6- Hashing vs. Encryption ?

                        Hashing ???
                        One-way, irreversible.
                        Used for integrity checks and storing sensitive data like passwords.

                        Encryption ???
                        Two-way, reversible with a key.
                        Used to securely transfer sensitive data.
