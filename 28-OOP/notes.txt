Q-: Does javaScript have classes ??
 Ans -: 
    Yes, JavaScript has classes. ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) introduced a class syntax that allows developers
to define classes in a way that is similar to class-based languages like Java or C++. However, it's important to
note that JavaScript's classes are primarily syntactical sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance system.

Under the hood, JavaScript's classes are still based on prototypes.
When you define a class in JavaScript, you are actually defining a constructor function
and adding methods to its prototype. 

by useing the new keyword , new object will create
by using the this keyword , current context will show
